The Car Price Prediction Web App is a Flask-based web application that utilizes machine learning to predict the approximate price of used cars based on various features. The app is designed to provide users with a quick and reliable estimation of a car's value, making it a valuable tool for both car buyers and sellers.

### Features:

- Input Form: Users can enter relevant details about the car they are interested in, such as the car's make, model, year of manufacture, fuel type, and other specifications.
- Machine Learning Model: The web app employs a trained machine learning model, built using regression techniques, to analyze the input data and predict the car's price based on historical data.
- Instant Prediction: Upon submitting the car details, the app provides an instant prediction of the car's estimated price, displayed on the screen.
- User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to input information seamlessly and receive price predictions quickly.

### Technologies Used:

- Flask: Used to create the web application and handle HTTP requests.
- Machine Learning (Python): Used to train the regression model for car price prediction.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Used for designing and styling the frontend of the web app.
- Pandas & NumPy: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: Employed for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- Pickle: Used to save and load the trained machine learning model.
